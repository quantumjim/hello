# Hello

I'm James Wootton. I try to debug quantum computers, and sometimes even try to use them. I should write about it all in this README, but for now I'll just suggest that you browse [my repos](https://github.com/quantumjim?tab=repositories).

I'm also <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.online/@Decodoku">@Decodoku@mastodon.online</a> on Mastadon.
